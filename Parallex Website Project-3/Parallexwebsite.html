        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>
            In Sociology, we are looking at human behaviour. Human behaviour is the term we use that refers 
            to all of the things that people do. There are many ways of explaining why certain people do things in particular ways.
            Some biologists and psychologists think that people behave as they do because they are animals who primarily act according 
            to their instincts. This is known as the “nature theory” of human behaviour. Other scientists and psychologists are researching 
            whether our behaviour is “genetic” i.e. certain types of behaviour are passed down from parent to child. Again, this is a nature 
            theory of human behaviour because it supports the belief that our behaviour is pre-programmed to a large extent. For example, 
            it has been debated whether there is a criminal gene which means some people are more likely to commit crime.Nurture arguments 
            focus on the way people are brought up and how their environment moulds their personality and behaviour. Sociologists argue 
            that some people are brought up to be kind and caring, and others are brought up to display very different forms of behaviour.
